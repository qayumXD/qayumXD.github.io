        I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for building elegant and performant applications. 
        I specialize in creating AI-powered solutions, from full-stack news portals that analyze 
        legal texts to computer vision systems that detect and map infrastructure using geospatial data. 
        With expertise in React, Node.js, and Python, I enjoy architecting scalable systems and 
        exploring new frontiers in machine learning and automation.

        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new frameworks, contributing to open source, 
        or architecting solutions for complex problems.
